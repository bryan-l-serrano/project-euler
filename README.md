my project euler solutions

These are some of my code for solutions to the problems I have completed from Project Euler.

Project Euler is a project to create difficult math problems for people to solve using programming techniques.

problem 5 works but is extremely inefficient and will take a very long time to run, so i suggest you don't run it.

problem 11 is not finished.
